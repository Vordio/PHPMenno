An open source Habbo-styled project which dates back to 2006.

--

This application was created my 13-year old me in 2006 with a few releases in the following years. In 2008 I handed over development to Jeroen who, together with the community, pushed a new release.

Beware, this application is ancient and contains some bugs. Still I wanted to preserve it before it gets lost :)


## Installation

The installation is very straight-forward. After cloning the project simply launch the index.php. This will trigger the installation process.

After entering your database information, choose an administrator username and password.
